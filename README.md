We use the Locustfile.py for load testing our cloud application deployed on AWS. Our application is a containerized open-source client-server application. For more information, please follow the link: https://github.com/simplyvinay/vue-expenses.

Locust test results can be found in Tests folder. All the tests are done while the application is horizatialy autoscaling, to see the test results without autoscaling, with both CPU configrations see AutoscalingOFF folder.
